# PyFindFiles

Find files (text or binary) containing text or patterns efficiently with Python, cross-platform.
Default is to only search files smaller than 50 MBytes.

Requires:
* Python &ge; 3.5
* Windows: need [SysInternals strings.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/strings
) on your PATH.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scivision/pyfindfiles

cd pyfindfiles

python -m pip install -e .
```

## Usage

`findtext` looks for strings inside text or binary files, and reports filename text is found in.

* `-v`: filename, line number, and text found


```sh
findtext Pattern "*.ext" root
```

Pattern
: text to search for

"*.ext"
: file extension(s) to search for

root
: top-level directory to search under


---

`findvid`

`findvid root` looks under top-level directory `root` for video files (by common file extensions)
